  * purchase.csv

# Key Takeaways and Recommendations 
Based on the [SQL analysis](/questions_and_answers.md), below are some key takeaways along with recommendations for Warby Parker: 

## Key Takeaways: 

 * Users appear to drop off from the style quiz when questions become unrelatable or sensitive.
 * Purchase rates are higher among users who receive five pairs of glasses versus three pairs to try on at home.
 * Narrow-to-medium frames in a rectangular or square shape appear to be the most popular picks among users. 

## Recommendations: 

 * **Quiz:**
   * Make question one on the style quiz a mandatory question to ensure optimal and accurate frame recommendations for users to try on at home.
   * Expand the choice options for question three in the style quiz to provide users with more shape preferences to ensure inclusivity and drive completion rate. Also  remove question five on most recent eye exam given its irrelevance to making frame suggestions for users.
 * **Home Try-On:**
   * Update Warby Parker's home try-on policy to allow for a max of five pairs to try on before a user has to make a purchase decision.
 * **Marketing:**
   * Promote Warby's top two fan favorites for new visitors to potentially drive home try-ons and purchases.
